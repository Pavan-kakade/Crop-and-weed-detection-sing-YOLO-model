🌾 Crop and Weed Detection Using YOLOv8
AI-based Precision Spraying System for Sesame Crop Farming
📌 Problem Statement

Weeds are unwanted plants that grow along with crops and consume essential resources such as water, nutrients, land area, and sunlight.
This leads to reduction in crop productivity and farmers commonly remove weeds using pesticides.

❌ When pesticides are sprayed over the entire field:

They may stick to crops

Cause harmful effects on human health

Increase cost due to wastage

Pollute soil and environment

✅ Therefore, a smart AI system is needed which can:

✔ Detect only weeds
✔ Spray pesticides only on detected weed areas
✔ Protect crop quality
✔ Reduce pesticide usage and cost
✔ Improve yield in a sustainable manner

🎯 Project Aim

"To develop an automated system that detects weeds separately from sesame crops and enables targeted pesticide spraying only on weeds to reduce chemical usage and increase crop productivity."

📊 Dataset Creation Process

This dataset was fully manually created on farmland:

Step	Work Done	Final Count
1️⃣ Data Collection	Photos captured of sesame crops & multiple weed types using a mobile camera	589 images
2️⃣ Data Cleaning	Removed irrelevant, blurry & low-quality images	546 usable images
3️⃣ Image Processing	Resized from 4000×3000 → 512×512×3 for faster training	546 processed images
4️⃣ Data Augmentation	Keras ImageDataGenerator used to increase dataset size	1300 total images
5️⃣ Manual Labeling	Bounding boxes drawn manually for 2 classes: crop, weed	1300 label files

✅ Labels are in YOLO format (one .txt per image)
